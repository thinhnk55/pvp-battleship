    illegal or tortious including, without limitation, \u201Chacking\u201D the Services,
    or infringing the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of MGS or
    third-parties.  Additionally, where the Services are a downloadable game and/or
    application (\u201CApp\u201D), MGS grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    revocable, limited license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use
    on authorized devices, unless otherwise specified. The App may not be copied,
    resold, or sublicensed. These Terms apply to all versions and updates to the
    App, including, without limitation, free and paid versions.  The App may include
    measures to control access to the App (including age controls), prevent unauthorized
    copies, or otherwise attempt to prevent anyone from exceeding the limited rights
    and licenses granted under these Terms. You may not take any action to circumvent
    or defeat such security features. If you disable or otherwise tamper with the
    technical protection measures, your license to use the App or other Services
    shall be considered automatically revoked.  2. Third-party product, services
    and links.  MGS may offer third-party products through the Services. You assume
    all risks and liabilities associated with the use of any such third-party products.
    Additionally, your rights and obligations regarding such products or services
    will be governed by the separate terms of use and privacy policies of the applicable
    third-party provider.  The Services may include hyperlinks to other websites
    over which MGS has no control. MGS is not responsible for the availability of
    such external sites or resources and will not be responsible or liable for any
    content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such
    third-party websites or resources.  3. Access to the services.  By using the
    Services, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the
    age of majority if that is not 18 years of age where you live) or that you have
    reviewed these Terms with your parent or guardian and he or she assents to these
    Terms on your behalf and takes full responsibility for your compliance with them.
    If you are under the age of 13, you must have permission from your parent or
    guardian in order to use the Services. If you do not have permission from your
    parent of guardian, certain features and functionality of the Services may be
    disabled. Information regarding use of your personal information can be found
    in MGS\u2019s Privacy Policy or in the privacy policy specific to the Service
    you are using.  You may be required to register an account before using certain
    Services (\u201CAccount\u201D). You may also be required or have the option to
    access the Services through a social networking service (\u201CSNS\u201D). Your
    Account is personal to you, and you may not rent, lease, sell, trade, gift, bequeath,
    or otherwise transfer it to anyone else. You agree to provide true and complete
    information about yourself when you register your Account and to keep it up to
    date. You may not have more than one Account or access the Services through more
    than one SNS at any given time. You are solely responsible for maintaining the
    confidentiality of your password and username and for any activities that occur
    under your Account. MGS does not authorize use of automated methods to sign up
    for an Account, and MGS reserves the right to immediately terminate your access
    to the Services or your Account if you breach these Terms or otherwise violate
    any applicable law, rule, or regulation in your jurisdiction.  You are responsible
    for the internet connection and/or mobile charges that you may incur for accessing
    and/or using the Services.  4. In-app purchases.  A. In-game Virtual Currency
    and Virtual Items  The Service may include an opportunity for you to earn, buy
    or otherwise obtain in-game currency (\u201CVirtual Currency\u201D) to access
    virtual, in-game digital goods or items (\u201CVirtual Items\u201D). Methods
    of obtaining Virtual Currency are at MGS\u2019s sole discretion. Virtual Currency
    and Virtual Items are not real currency, do not have monetary value, and may
    not be redeemed for legal currency, or items of value outside of the Services. 
    Virtual Currency and Virtual Items obtained via the Service are provided to you
    under a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license
    to use within the Service. You have no property interest, right or title in or
    to any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items appearing or originating in the Service,
    and they may not be transferred or resold in any manner, including, without limitation,
    by means of any direct sale or auction service.  MGS has no liability for hacking
    or loss of your Virtual Currency or Virtual Items or any goods or services obtained
    via Virtual Currency. MGS has no obligation to, and will not, reimburse you for
    any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items obtained via Virtual Currency. MGS reserves
    the right, in its sole discretion and without prior notification, to change or
    limit the price, availability, or order quantity of any Virtual Currency or Virtual
    Items and to refuse to provide you with any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items. 
    Virtual Currency may have an expiration date. If your Virtual Currency or Virtual
    Items expire and you still have an active Account, MGS may offer conversion of
    such Virtual Currency into Virtual Items for you in its sole discretion, however
    MGS is under no obligation to do so. Virtual Currency and Virtual Items may be
    forfeited if: (a) your Account or access to the Services is terminated or suspended
    for any reason; (b) you breach these Terms; (c) MGS discontinues availability
    of the Service; or (d) you disassociate from the Service.  B. Subscriptions 
    In some of our games, you may pay a fee for a subscription membership (\u201CSubscription\u201D). 
    When you buy a Subscription, you agree to the following:  A Subscription fee
    will be charged to your chosen payment method in the app store of your device\u2019s
    platform (\u201CApp Store\u201D). You will be charged the Subscription fee displayed
    at the time of sale; and  Your Subscription will automatically renew for the
    applicable length of your Subscription until either you or MGS cancels your Subscription.
    By way of example, if you buy a 3-month Subscription, the Subscription will automatically
    renew for another 3-month period (unless either you or MGS cancels your Subscription). 
    Canceling Subscriptions:  To stop automatic renewal of your Subscription and
    automatic withdrawal of Subscription fees, you must cancel your Subscription
    within 24 hours before it renews for the length of the next Subscription period.
    You may cancel your Subscription at any time by managing the subscription settings
    at your App Store.  For the Google Play store, instructions for canceling your
    Subscription may be found here: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481 
    For the Apple App store, instructions for canceling your Subscription may be
    found here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039  Other Subscription Terms: 
    To receive any daily rewards as part of your Subscription, you must open the
    game that you have the Subscription for. You will not receive rewards for the
    days on which you did not open the game.  C. Payments for Subscriptions, Virtual
    Currencies, and Virtual Items  When you pay for a Subscription, Virtual Currencies,
    and/or Virtual Items, all payments are charged and processed by the App Store
    (e.g. the Google Play store or the Apple App store), so please review your app
    store\u2019s payment terms for additional payment terms that may apply.  You
    agree that all payments for Virtual Currency, Virtual Items, and Subscriptions
    are final. No refunds will be given, except in MGS\u2019s sole and absolute discretion. 
    5. Title.  Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, any and all title, ownership,
    rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Services including all
    content therein (collectively the \u201CMGS Content\u201D) shall remain in MGS
    and/or its suppliers, and are protected by the copyright laws of the United Kingdom,
    the United States and other jurisdictions around the world via international

    but not limited, to photos incorporating elements or graphics from games, screenshots
    or a video of your game play. MGS retains all rights, title and interest in and
    to the MGS Content. You retain all rights to Your Content; provided, however,
    that MGS shall have an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully transferable
    and sub-licensable worldwide right and license to Your Content for any purpose,
    including, but not limited to, the rights to reproduce, copy, adapt, modify,
    perform, display, publish, broadcast, transmit, or otherwise communicate to the

    without any further notice or compensation to you. Except where prohibited by
    law, you hereby waive any moral rights of paternity, publication, reputation,
    or attribution with respect to MGS\u2019s use of Your Content.  6. Disclaimer
    of warranty and limit of liability.  MGS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, AND/OR
    GUARANTEE OF THE SUITABILITY OF THE SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES, OR THAT THE USE
    OF THE SAME WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER
    HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR FUNCTION PROPERLY IN COMBINATION WITH ANY THIRD-PARTY
    TECHNOLOGY, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA.  THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \u201CAS
    IS\u201D AND ALL CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
    ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. FURTHER,
    MGS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS
    TO THE OPERATION OF THE SAME, OR TO THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, COMMUNICATIONS,
    MATERIALS, OR PRODUCTS AND SERVICE CONTAINED THEREIN. YOUR USE OF THE MGS SERVICES
    IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  MGS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING
    FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. CERTAIN REGIONAL LAWS DO NOT
    ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN
    DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS,
    OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.  YOU
    FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MGS IS NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD MGS LIABLE,
    FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD-PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES AND OTHER
    THIRD-PARTY SITES, AND THAT THE RISK OF USING OR ACCESSING THE SERVICES, AND
    OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING, RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.  7. Indemnification. 
    You agree to hold harmless, indemnify and defend MGS, its licensors, affiliates
    and suppliers and their respective officers, directors and employees, from and
    against any losses, damages, fines and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees
    and costs) due to, arising out of, or relating to any information or item, including,
    without limitation, Your Content, Forum Content, and/or Inappropriate Content
    you may submit, post, transmit or make available through the Forums or Services,
    your use of the Forums and Services, your connection to the Forums and Services,
    your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any law, regulation or third-party
    right. Without limiting your indemnification obligations described herein, MGS
    reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control
    of any matter subject to indemnification by you.  8. Termination.  These Terms
    will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with any term hereof. You
    and MGS have the right to terminate or cancel your Account, at any time for any
    reason and without notice. Upon termination you shall immediately discontinue
    use of the Services. Your obligations under Sections 5, 10, 12, and 13 shall
    survive any termination.  9. No assignment.  These Terms and the licenses granted
    to you herein are personal to you, and may not be assigned prior to obtaining
    MGS\u2019s express written consent.  10. Arbitration and dispute resolution. 
    These Terms and all disputes and claims relating in any way to, or arising out
    of, these Terms, the Services, the Forums, Forum Content, Inappropriate Content,
    Your Content, or your use of the Software or Forums shall be governed by the
    laws of England and Wales. You and MGS agree that the exclusive remedy for all
    disputes and claims relating in any way to, or arising out of, these Terms, the
    Services, the Forums, or your use of the Services or Forums shall be final and
    binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the
    ICC International Court of Arbitration (\u201CICA\u201D). To the fullest extent
    permitted by law: (a) no arbitration under these Terms shall be joined to any
    other arbitration; (b) no class arbitration proceedings shall be permitted; (c)
    no finding or stipulation of fact in any other arbitration, judicial or similar
    proceeding may be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration
    hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between you and MGS); and
    (d) no conclusion of law in any other arbitration may be given any weight in
    any arbitration hereunder (unless determined in another proceeding between you
    and MGS ). You and MGS must commence an arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration
    with the ICA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim
    first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving
    rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not
    asserted within that time period (if applicable law prohibits a one year limitations
    period for asserting claims, the claim must be asserted within the shortest time
    period in excess of one year that is permitted by applicable law). Both parties
    will be responsible for their respective arbitration fees.  11. Feedback.  MGS
    does not accept unsolicited feedback, suggestions or other information about
    the Services or other aspects of its business. If you provide MGS with feedback
    or other ideas, you agree that MGS is free to use any feedback provided by you
    for any purpose (without compensation to you), including, without limitation,
    improving its products and services and creating derivative products.  12. General. 
    These Terms, along with the Privacy Policy, and any other privacy policy applicable
    to the specific Services you are using, constitute the complete and final agreement
    between MGS and you with respect to your use of the Services and may not be modified
    by you except in a writing duly signed by you and an authorized representative
    of MGS . You agree that your breach of these Terms will cause MGS immediate and
    irreparable harm and MGS will be entitled, notwithstanding the arbitration clause
    set forth in Section 11 above, to seek injunctive relief without the necessity
    of posting bond. MGS and you are independent parties and nothing in these Terms
    creates an employment or agent relationship. If any provision herein is held
    to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed in that matter only to
    the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and shall not affect the enforceability
    of the remaining provisions. The failure of either party to enforce any right
    or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 
    MGS may make changes to the Services, these Terms, or its Privacy Policy from
    time to time. MGS will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of any
    material changes. All such changes will become effective immediately upon notice
    and/or posting. If any of these changes are deemed invalid, void, or for any
    reason unenforceable, that change will be deemed severable and will not affect
    the validity and enforceability of any unchanged portions of the Services, these
    Terms, or the Privacy Policy. MGS may transfer or assign the Services, these
    Terms, or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any third-party of MGS\u2019s
    choosing. These Terms will insure to the benefit of and be binding upon MGS\u2019s
    respective successors and assigns. "
