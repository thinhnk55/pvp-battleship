To define your own asset categories, go to Settings and add an entry to <i>Categories</i> list. The first category to match for a given path wins.
***
To select multiple categories or scenes from combo boxes hold <b>Control</b> key before clicking on the drop down.
***
Can't read details of assets in the map view? Try to narrow down the cryteria by category, scene or size.
***
You can use wildcards (<b>*</b>) in your category patterns.
***
If your report has assets' details, you can filter grid/map using search box and a pattern "<property>:<value>" (e.g. "format:rgb")
***
Bottom panel can be freely resized -- just drag the edge! Same applies to assets' details columns -- drag the left edge to resize.
***
To find MonoBehaviours that are not used on any scenes/resources type <b>ScriptReferences:"0"</b> into the search box (details collection required). 
They still end up in the build because they can be created from code too.
***
To find uncompressed textures type <b>format:rgb</b> into the search box (details collection required).
***
If scenes seem to big, it may be caused by static batching. Click on '+' in the top right corner of the grid and check <b>Vertices</b> and <b>Triangles</b> to see if that's the reason.
***
You can sort by multiple columns. Simply press Ctrl+click on a column header.
